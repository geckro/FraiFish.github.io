            Hi I am Frai I have a silly kitty named Delphine and another silly kitty that doesn't have a name in English
        </p>
        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p>
        I am currently a second year university student in Canada,
        majoring in math and computer science (Might pick up a minor in English) <br><br>
        I started making this website mostly as a hobby, also mostly because I've been having reasons to believe that
        there are some parts of myself that are worth consigning to something more tangible than just my memory,
        and partly because I think a website(as well as the mileage
        that comes with developing it) will be useful for me in the future... I suppose the list goes on. <br><br>
        As I am writing this I'm currently enjoying a week-long break from school after (most of) the midterms,
        so I'll use this time to do as much of the groundwork for this site as possible so it will not take too much
        commitment to maintain when I have less free time.
    </p>
        <h2>My interests</h2>
        <p>
        <!-- href links needed: pet breeds, link to Sakuzyo-->
        I am BOTH a cat person and a dog person. My favorite cat breeds are the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragdoll" target="_blank">ragdoll</a> and the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_cat" target="_blank">Siamese</a>.
        Servals and caracals, which are not domestic cats, are pretty cool.
        My favorite dog breed is the golden retriever. <br><br>
        I enjoy cooking in my free time, I make meals for myself on a daily basis, at least as much as I eat out.
        My(uncontested) favorite food is curry. <br><br>
        My music taste is mostly Japan-oriented and prominently electronic,
        with j-pop(including but not limited to vocaloid), artcore, trance,
        and some high energy ear-shattering sounds like j-core and hardstyle. My favorite musician is 
            <a href="https://Sakuzyo.com" target="_blank">Sakuzyo</a>.<br><br>
        I enjoy indie games, multiplayer games which focus on the social aspect such as ff14 and (very recently)
        webfishing, and as of now I have been hopelessly addicted to rhythm games for a year: I play Arcaea on mobile,
        and Gekichumai at the arcade. I also play Synth riders on my VR sometimes.<br><br>
        I've recently been trying to pick up doing 3D modelling on Blender but progress on that kinda came to a halt
        due to the midterm season. I plan to finish
