        宛城、炎上！！(Enjou, Enjou！！, lit. "Wancheng, burn!!!") is a song made for the rhythm game CHUNITHM, which is thematically stylized after the Battle of Wancheng between Cao Cao and Zhang Xiu during the Three-Kingdoms period. The lyrics of the song are intended to be Cao Cao's words.
        <br><br>
        Sometime between 5 February and 6 March 197, Cao Cao led his forces to attack Zhang Xiu. When his forces reached the Yu River, Zhang Xiu surrendered without putting up a fight. Cao Cao stayed in Wancheng for more than 10 days after receiving Zhang Xiu's surrender. During this time, he became attracted to the  widow of Zhang Xiu's late uncle Zhang Ji, and took her as his concubine. Zhang Xiu, feeling outraged and humiliated, plotted revenge against Cao Cao. Cao Cao heard about Zhang Xiu's unhappiness and he planned to have Zhang Xiu assassinated. At the time, Zhang Xiu had a close aide Hu Che'er, who was known for his exceptional courage. Cao Cao was so impressed by Huche'er that he gave him some gold as a gift. As Zhang Xiu already knew that Cao Cao wanted to have him assassinated, he thought that Cao Cao was trying to bribe Huche'er to be the assassin, so he quickly launched a preemptive surprise attack on Cao Cao's camp.  Cao Cao was totally caught off guard by Zhang Xiu's attack, and his forces suffered a disastrous defeat – especially when Zhang Xiu had already planned out the attack and deployed his troops near Cao Cao's camp. Cao Cao had no choice but to retreat, with only a few horsemen accompanying him. One of Cao Cao's most prided generals, Dian Wei, remained behind to cover Cao Cao's retreat, and is eventually overwhelmed and killed in battle. During his escape, Cao Cao injured his face and foot when his horse, Jueying, threw him off its back after being hit by arrows. Cao Cao also sustained an arrow wound in his right arm. Cao Cao's eldest son and nephew were also killed by Zhang Xiu's forces later.
        <br><br>
        In summary, Cao Cao lost a competent military officer and two of his blood to sleep with a woman. This event paints Cao Cao in an arrogant and perverted light, which is his personality in the song, Enjou, Enjou！！. The song seems to begin right before Zhang Xiu launched his attack, with Cao Cao revelling and being surprised. Notably, fire is not documented to be an element of this battle, and it's likely the song is only titled(and themed) thus because the Japanese word for Wancheng(宛城，Enjou) and Fire attack(炎上，Enjou) are pronounced the exact same.
